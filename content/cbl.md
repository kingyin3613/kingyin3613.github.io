# The Connector-Beam Lattice Model for wood

Interest in engineered wood products (EWP) in construction industry is at a new high due to the low CO2 emission relative to structural properties and innovations of mass timber (e.g., gluelam, cross laminated timber). However, persistent issues stuck in front of the development of engineered wood products are the complex material behaviors of wood due to its inherent material anisotropy and heterogeneity, and consequently the reliance on extensive broad-based laboratory testing for the design and code approval of new products. To guide the laboratory testing and provide a computational tool to obtain data with high fidelity for the material properties of EWP, we propose a Connector-Beam Lattice Model for Wood (CBL-W) in 3D, which aims to naturally capture the morphological features of wood cellular micro-structure by using the connector-beam system, and to explicitly simulate the damages/cracks at the constituent material level by employing discrete-type cohesive fracture constitutive laws. The CBL-W model is a discrete-type model established on a morphologically-reproduced geometry of wood cellular structure at the microscale, and is calibrated and validated through a series of laboratory tests and mining of a vast database of wood product performance.
