# Voronoi tessellation-based mesh generator for the mesoscale structure of prismatic cellular materials

Wood has a unique micromorphology featuring a local pattern of prismatic cells and a global pattern of growth rings. Understanding the role of locally irregular and globally radial micromorphology in determining material properties offers a new path to unveil the behavior of wood and wood-based materials with functionalities, such as anisotropic material properties, stress redirection, and oriented impact energy dissipation. 
While laboratory and in-situ imaging approaches are reliable for the reconstruction of high-resolution wood micromorphologies in computational modeling, algorithm-based generation of wood microstructure geometries are still in high demand. They have the advantage of lowering cost while enabling rapid prototyping and stochastic analysis of wood products during the design phase. This study develops a rapid wood micromorphology modeling technique, based on Voronoi tessellation and Lloyd's relaxation algorithm, to mimic the prismatic cellular microstructure for softwood in 3D. The generated wood microstructure is then integrated with the Connector-Beam Lattice Model for wood (CBL-W) to establish a pipeline for numerical simulations of the quasi-static and fracture properties of wood and wood-based materials. We utilized the experimental study of growth ring orientation effects in the transverse plane as a benchmark, to obtain insights into geometric generation techniques and the fracture behavior of wood.
