How to setup a local web server

1. Download and Install NodeJS

2. Open a command line (cmd) in Windows or terminal in MAC OS/Linux
and enter the following:

npm install -g httpserver

3. Change to your directory containing your working files (e.g. js, html files):

cd C:\Users\yourname\terrain

4. Enter the following:

httpserver

you should see something like:

server started: http://0.0.0.0:8080

5. Open your browser and go to the address http://localhost:8080/

now you can see your working directory 

(or directly go to the address like http://localhost:8080/Flight.html to open the html file)
