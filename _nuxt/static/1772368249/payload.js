The basic element of this lattice model is the 3D curved beam characterized by (a) arbitrary curvature and torsion of the beam axis and (b) an irregular, cruciform cross-section. The various branches for the cross-section represent the cell walls of the cellular wood microstructure and the beam axis is the line at which various cell walls meet. The Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) technique has been employed to describe the beam geometries accurately. The joints (both transverse and longitudinal) between neighboring beams are modeled with the \"connector\" elements, characterized by the smeared crack model for the cell wall failure and by the cohesive fracture laws for the softening strain-stress relationship of quasi-brittle materials (including wood, fiber-composites).&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u002F\u003EThe beam lattice and connector elements have been implemented with Abaqus user subroutines \"UEL\" and \"VUEL\" for both implicit and explicit analyses. A preprocessing-analysis-postprocessing pipeline has been formed. The codes has been optimized to allow the simulation of large models (number of elements \u003E 10 millions), the length scale of specimens can be up to tens centimeters as a mesoscale model with element sizes of 10~100 microns.\n&nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u002F\u003ECollaborating with experimentalists from the University of Maine, this model has proved its capability in accurately simulating the orthotropic nature, as well as the annual ring-oriented fracture behaviors of wood materials. This model can elucidate mesoscale-level understanding on how the cellular morphology influences the macroscopic properties of the material. This insight can be harnessed for the design of natural and engineered \"wood-like\" materials with special functionalities, such as anisotropic programmable material properties, stress redirection, and oriented impact energy dissipation.",list:[{type:a,file:"morphology",title:"Modeling of wood mesostructure",img:"\u002FPine_cs.jpg"},{type:a,file:"IGAbeam",title:"Isogeometric beam lattice",img:"\u002Fbeam.png"},{type:a,file:"cbl",title:"Connector-beam lattice model for wood",img:"\u002Fcbl.gif"}]},{category:"Computational multimodel framework for coupled transport-mechanical analyses of lattice systems",desc:"The mechanical behaviors of porous materials, particularly their susceptibility to cracking, can be influenced by various chemical and physical phenomena. Changes in environmental conditions can have opposing effects on different materials: for example, rise in temperature makes porous materials either stronger and more brittle (e.g., early-age concrete) or weaker and more ductile (e.g., wood and composites) within a typical application temperature range. Likewise, variations in moisture content or temperature can cause volumetric changes that, when restrained, lead to the development of stress within the material. In addition to mechanical loading, hygral or thermal effects may also contribute to crack initiation and propagation. Consequently, the durability of materials is often affected by a combination of mechanical, hygral, and\u002For thermal processes, which typically commence at production stages and evolve over the life cycle of the material.
